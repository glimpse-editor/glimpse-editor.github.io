You can also find and download older versions of Glimpse Image Editor and the software program source code from [Github](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/releases).

### Windows
Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 is supported on 32-bit and 64-bit systems running Windows 7 or later. If you experience problems during installation, you should review the [Known Issues](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/wiki/Known-Issues-%28Windows%29) page before reporting a bug.

If you do not know which installer to download, we recommend that you choose the 64-bit one as it is the best supported.

#### Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 Installer
This installs a native x64 version of Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 with [G'MIC](https://gmic.eu/). You should choose this option if you know you are running a 64-bit version of Windows and do not need to upgrade an existing Glimpse Image Editor 0.1.2 installation.

Support for legacy 32-bit plugins is still experimental with the 64-bit Windows installer. You should [review our wiki](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/wiki#third-party-plugin-installation-guides) before reporting any bugs.

#### Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 (x86) Installer
This installs a 32-bit (x86) version of Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0. You should choose this option if you are upgrading an existing Glimpse Image Editor 0.1.2 installation, or are using an ARM-based device such as the [Surface Pro X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro_X).

#### External Download Mirrors
These servers are not directly supported by us, and are maintained by third party developers. We strongly recommend running a virus scan on your system whenever you download the Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 installer from these sources.

* Repositories: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/glimpse/) | [WinGet](https://winget.run/pkg/Glimpse/Glimpse)
* Direct downloads: [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Editors/Glimpse-Image-Editor.shtml)

### Linux
We distribute Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 on Flathub for end users. We also provide a continuously-updating Linux AppImage that follows the tip of our development branch.

#### Flatpak
If `flatpak` is not already installed on your machine, follow these instructions: https://flatpak.org/setup/

##### Installing from Flathub
You can find Glimpse Image Editor by searching in your distribution's software center, or you can [click on this link](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.glimpse_editor.Glimpse) from Flathub.

Alternatively you can install it manually at the command line:
```
$ flatpak install flathub org.glimpse_editor.Glimpse
```

##### Installing from other third-party Flatpak repositories
If you would prefer to use your own third party repository for dependency resolution instead of Flathub, we also provide a [single-file bundle](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/single-file-bundles.html):

**glimpse-0.2.0r2.flatpak** (49.6 MB) | [Direct download](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/releases/download/v0.2.0/glimpse-0.2.0r2.flatpak) | *Sha256: 81b5707e12e44788f90f98c9c357bb213e7774b01369546e919b496306f51407*

To install the single-file bundle at the command line:
```
$ flatpak install glimpse-0.2.0r2.flatpak
```

#### Snap
If `snapd` is not already installed on your machine, follow these instructions: https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd

##### Installing from Snap Store
You can find Glimpse Image Editor by searching in your distribution's software center, or you can [click on this link](https://snapcraft.io/glimpse-editor) from the Snap Store.

Alternatively you can install it manually at the command line:
```
$ sudo snap install glimpse-editor
```

#### AppImage
AppImages for Linux behave much like a [Universal Binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary) does on macOS. You download a single file containing the application and its dependencies, set executable permissions, then run it. You can find more information and links to optional update tools at https://appimage.github.io/Glimpse-Image-Editor/.

We have configured a Github Action that builds and publishes a new AppImage every time we make changes to our development branch here: https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/releases/tag/continuous

You should select this installation option if a stable version of Glimpse Image Editor has not been provided in your package manager and you are unable to run our provided Flatpak on your system. You will also need to accept that you may have to deal with some bugs in exchange for receiving new features before everyone else does.

**Please note**: We do not include support for Python 2 plug-ins with our AppImage. Python 2 [is now end of life](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/), and as a result it is being phased out in many Linux distributions and package managers.

#### Community-supported sources
These builds are provided by third parties in the wider Linux community. We do not create, package or directly support these sources, so if you raise any bugs for them that would not apply to most Linux users, we may direct you elsewhere to get the issue fixed.

* [`glimpse-editor-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/glimpse-editor-git/) @ AUR repository for [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
* [`media-gfx/glimpse`](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/guru.git/tree/media-gfx/glimpse) @ Guru repository for [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/)
* [`glimpse:IBboard`](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3AIBBoard%3Adesktop&package=glimpse) @ Open Build Service for [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)

### MacOS
Unfortunately Glimpse Image Editor is not supported on MacOS. We recommend either running the Windows version in a virtualized environment or sticking with the [GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/). 

You may also be interested in trying [Seashore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seashore/id1448648921?mt=12), an older fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program designed specifically for MacOS. While it does have fewer features, it may still be suitable for your intended use case.

We are investigating the possibility of distributing Glimpse Image Editor through [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/), a popular third-party package manager for macOS. [#402](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/issues/402)

### Build our code
We have provided instructions for building and packaging the Glimpse Image Editor source code on our project wiki: https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/wiki

You can also test out our own beta and development releases by following these instructions: https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/wiki#testing
