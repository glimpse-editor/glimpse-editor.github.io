This release rebases Glimpse Image Editor on the GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.18, introduces helpful configuration settings from [PhotoGIMP](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP), and adds 64-bit support on Windows.

We have completely rewritten our Windows installers from scratch, providing users with the option to install in custom locations, and fully deprecating Python 2 components on that platform. We have also pre-bundled [G'MIC](https://gmic.eu/) with our 64-bit Windows installer.

Key underlying dependencies and changes have also been backported on Windows and Linux to provide a more stable and secure experience for all Glimpse Image Editor users across both platforms.

## Installation
Linux users can install Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 as a Flatpak from the Flathub repository, and as a Snap from the Snap Store. There are also a number of additional installation options for Linux detailed on our [Downloads](/downloads/) page.

Windows users can use an MSI file to install Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 on 32-bit and 64-bit systems running Windows 7 or later. We chose that type of installer to assist businesses and schools using centralised software management systems. The two we have provided can also be found on the [Downloads](/downloads/) page.
