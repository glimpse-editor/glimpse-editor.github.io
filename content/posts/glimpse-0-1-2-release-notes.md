title: "Glimpse 0.1.2 Release Notes"
date: 2020-03-02T17:00:00+00:00
draft: false
---
This release iterates on our very first "minimal viable product" release. The primary objective was to improve the experience for Windows users and fix non-English translation files.

This is also the first release where we have provided a source tarball for Linux distribution packagers. Please note that you will need to mark `libgimp` as a conflicting package as there is a lot of code and file name refactoring we still need to do.

We also took community feedback on board and reinstated the "Color" icon pack and "Grey" UI theme. Upstream contributors are also now credited in **Help** > **About** > **Credits**.

## Installation
Linux users can install Glimpse Image Editor 0.1.2 as a Flatpak from the Flathub repository. There are also a number of additional installation options for Linux detailed on our [Downloads](/downloads/) page.

Windows users can use an MSI file to install Glimpse Image Editor 0.1.2 on 32-bit and 64-bit systems running Windows 7 or later. We chose that type of installer to assist businesses and schools using centralised software management systems. This can also be found on the [Downloads](/downloads/) page.
